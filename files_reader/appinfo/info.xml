    <description>
	Reader is an ebook reader based on a pure javascript epub renderer. It only works for books formatted according to the epub standard.

	Using the futurepress epub.js renderer (https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js) it provides near-native looks, especially when used full-screen. Turn pages by pressing the left/right hand side of the screen/window or using the cursor keys (if you have those), use the sidebar to browse through chapters or bookmarks and add annotations.

	Reader has a night mode (toggled by clicking or pressing the book title/author on top of the viewer) to read in the dark without waking up the neighbours. This is obviously most effective when used full-screen. The colours used for night mode are configurable in the Settings dialog.

	Also in Settings you'll find the option to use ignore any internal formatting in the book by forcing a given font style and size.
